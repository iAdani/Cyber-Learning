# Bandit Wargame

This repository tracks my progress through the Bandit wargame from OverTheWire. Bandit is designed for absolute beginners to learn the basics of using the command line and navigating Linux systems through a series of hands-on levels. Each level presents a small challenge that builds foundational cybersecurity and Linux skills.

I'll be documenting how I complete each level, commands I used, and what I learned along the way.
