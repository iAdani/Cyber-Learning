# Natas Wargame

This repository tracks my progress through the Natas wargame by OverTheWire. Natas is focused on web security, covering a wide range of real-world web vulnerabilities including authentication bypasses, information disclosure, input manipulation, client/server-side logic flaws, and basic web exploitation techniques.

Each level is a hosted web page with a challenge that can be solved using tools like browser developer tools, curl, Burp Suite, and basic scripting. I’ll document each level with steps, explanations, and any payloads used. Some levels may be solved with hints or public write-ups, but I’ll always explain the solution in my own words.
