# OverTheWire Wargames

This repository documents my personal journey through the OverTheWire wargames — a series of hands-on cybersecurity challenges designed to teach practical skills in Linux, web security, cryptography, binary exploitation, and more.

## What is OverTheWire?

[OverTheWire](https://overthewire.org/wargames/) is a free platform offering interactive cybersecurity wargames. Each wargame consists of a series of levels that must be completed by solving technical challenges. These challenges are intentionally vulnerable systems or applications that teach you to think like an attacker — identifying weaknesses, exploiting misconfigurations, and gaining access to the next level.

Unlike theory-heavy courses, OverTheWire gives real-world, terminal-based practice that mirrors how ethical hackers and penetration testers work.

## What Are Wargames?

Wargames are cybersecurity training environments where each level is a mini Capture the Flag challenge. You "break into" the next level using legitimate techniques such as:

- File and user permission manipulation
- Binary exploitation
- Web application attacks
- Cryptographic analysis
- Scripting, reverse engineering, and debugging

Wargames train not just your technical ability, but your mindset — to be curious, analytical, and persistent.

## Why Am I Doing This?

I’m a Computer Science graduate working toward a career in cybersecurity. While I’ve learned theory in school (e.g. C programming, systems architecture, buffer overflows), I wanted a hands-on, self-driven way to turn that knowledge into practical skill.

OverTheWire challenges are helping me:
- Apply my technical foundations to real security problems
- Build a solid understanding of Linux, privilege escalation, and exploits
- Train for roles in penetration testing, SOCs, and CTF competitions
- Document and showcase my learning journey publicly

Each subfolder in this repo contains write-ups, explanations, and command history for a different wargame. I sometimes used guides or community hints for tougher levels, but always made sure to deeply understand and explain everything in my own words.
