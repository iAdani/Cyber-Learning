# Leviathan Wargame

This repository documents my progress through the Leviathan wargame from OverTheWire. Leviathan is focused on Linux privilege escalation and basic binary exploitation concepts. It builds on foundational command-line knowledge and introduces challenges involving SUID binaries, input manipulation, and simple logic flaws.

Each level involves escalating access from one user to another, simulating real-world scenarios often seen in penetration tests. Iâ€™ll be detailing how I solved each level, the commands and tools I used, and the key concepts I learned. Some levels were completed with the help of community hints or public write-ups, but I made sure to try by myself, understand and explain each solution in my own words.
